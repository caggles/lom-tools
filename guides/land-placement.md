# Legend of Mana - Land Placement Guide

Does it matter where I place new artifacts? Does it matter what order I place them in? Yes, and yes!

> Note: this guide does not provide step-by-step instructions for when/where to place your artifacts in order to get a specific benefit. This guide explains the mechanics behind land placement so you can get specific results without having to follow a step-by-step guide like that. If you want a step-by-step guide, the [walkthrough from LegendOfMana.Info](https://legendofmana.info/walkthrough/maps/) is a great option. You'll need to use their event guide to make sure you get the correct artifacts in the correct order.

There are two systems that are affected by where and when you place new artifacts: land levels and elemental levels.

**Land levels** are a hidden number associated with each land when you place it. Land levels affect:
* the average level of enemies that appear in the land
* the items that appear in shops within that land

**Elemental levels** for each land can be seen along the bottom left edge of the map when you highlight a particular land. Elemental levels affect:
* the level of specific enemies within the land
* which events can occur within the land
* how quickly your orchard produces fruit
* which demi-human pets will appear in the land
* the probably of a particular spirit appearing in a land when hunting for coins

You'll find more details about these effects below!

## Land Levels

Land level is determined when you place the artifact for that land and does not change. It's determined by the number of lands already placed on your map and by how far the land is from your home. 

The higher the land level, the higher the level of enemies that appear in the land and the higher the level of items that appear in the land's shops. In other words, if you were wondering why your Domina sells MenosBronze weapons while your Lumina sells WendelSilver ones, this is why!

### How Is Land Level Calculated?

The formula for land level is pretty simple:

```
Land Level = 
  horizontal distance from Home 
+ vertical distance from Home 
+ number of artifacts placed on the map (including this one)
```

Let's look at an example map to explain things a bit more!
