                <h1>Legend of Mana - Land Placement Guide</h1>

                <h3>Why Do I Care Where I Place Lands?</h3>
                <p>
                    All lands have two sets of traits:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Land Levels</b></li>
                    <li><b>Elemental Levels</b></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <b>Land levels</b> are a single number that gets assigned to the land based on when you place it and how far it is from your Home. You can't check the land level of a specific land - this is a hidden value. Thankfully, it isn't too hard to calculate! Land levels hav the following effects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The base level of all the enemies in the land is determined by land-level</li>
                    <li>The inventory of most shops is determined by land level</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can see your <b>elemental levels</b> for each land - when you select the land on the map, the little coloured "pies" running along the bottom-left edge of the map display that land's elemental levels. Elemental levels have the following effects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Certain events are only available when specific lands have specific elemental levels</li>
                    <li>Demihuman pets become available in certain lands when they reach certain elemental levels</li>
                    <li>The level of certain enemies within the land can vary depending on elemental levels</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Calculating Land Levels</h3>
                <p>The formula for a land's level is <code>(vertical distance from Home) + (horizontal distance from Home) + (number of artifacts placed on the map, including this one)</code>. Let's give an example.</p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    H D
                </div>
                <p>
                    Here we have a map from the very beginning of the game - all we have so far is <b>H</b>ome, and <b>D</b>omina.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Home always has a land level of <b>1 =
                    <span class=tooltip>0<span class="tooltiptext">vertical distance from Home</span></span> +
                    <span class=tooltip>0<span class="tooltiptext">horizontal distance from Home</span></span> +
                    <span class=tooltip>1<span class="tooltiptext">number of artifacts placed on the map, including this one</span></span></b>
                    because it is always the first land placed!
                </p>
                <div class="callout">
                    Hint! You can mouse over or tap the numbers in the equation to see what each one means!
                </div>
                <p>
                    Domina, likewise, always has a land level of <b>3 =
                    <span class=tooltip>0<span class="tooltiptext">vertical distance from Home</span></span> +
                    <span class=tooltip>1<span class="tooltiptext">horizontal distance from Home</span></span> +
                    <span class=tooltip>2<span class="tooltiptext">number of artifacts placed on the map, including this one</span></span></b>
                    because it's always the second land placed, and always right next to Home!
                </p>
                <p>Now we head into Domina and pick up the Broken Wheel artifact, and place it next to Domina, like so:</p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    H D L
                </div>
                <p>
                    And now we have <b>L</b>uon Highway next to Domina, with a land level of <b>5 =
                    <span class=tooltip>0<span class="tooltiptext">vertical distance from Home</span></span> +
                    <span class=tooltip>2<span class="tooltiptext">horizontal distance from Home</span></span> +
                    <span class=tooltip>3<span class="tooltiptext">number of artifacts placed on the map, including this one</span></span></b>
                </p>
                <p>Now let's go pick up the Jade Egg and place it below our Home:</p>
                <div class="codeblock">
                    H D L <br>
                    M
                </div>
                <p>
                    ...so that we have <b>M</b>ekiv Caverns with a land level of <b>5 =
                    <span class=tooltip>1<span class="tooltiptext">vertical distance from Home</span></span> +
                    <span class=tooltip>0<span class="tooltiptext">horizontal distance from Home</span></span> +
                    <span class=tooltip>4<span class="tooltiptext">number of artifacts placed on the map, including this one</span></span></b>
                </p>
                <p>Notice how Mekiv Caverns has the same land level as Luon, even though it was placed later? You can use order and location to manipulate land levels this way. If there's a particular land that seems difficult, placing it closer to Home will lower the land level and make it a bit easier!</p>

                <h3>Land Levels and Shops</h3>
                <p>If you want to temper weapons, you'll need to pay particular attention to the land levels of your towns, because you need to make sure you have access to most/all of the material shops.</p>
